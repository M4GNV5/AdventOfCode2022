## Advent of Code 2022

My solutions for the [Advent of Code 2022](http://adventofcode.com/2022)

Not sure how much time i will have. My previous attempts in
[2017](https://github.com/M4GNV5/AdventOfCode-2017)
and [2018](https://github.com/M4GNV5/AdventOfCode2018) were never complete.

Might do different languages each day or just some
[PointerScript](https://github.com/M4GNV5/PointerScript)
and Haskell
